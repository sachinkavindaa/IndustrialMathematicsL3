This project becomes a reality with the kind support and help of many individuals. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all of them.

First, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. L. W. Somathilake for his continuous contribution and supervision throughout the completion of this project which was invaluable.

I am extremely thankful to Prof. Leslie Jayasekara, Head of Mathematics Department, for offering us this course to get this opportunity to pursue our degree.

Besides my supervisor, I wish to thank Dr.Pubudu Thilan for conducting previous lectures and offering us Java programming opportunities. Without her passionate participation,
this project could not have been successfully conducted.

I am also thankful to all academic staff members of the Department of Mathematics of the Faculty of Science University of Ruhuna for their kind advice.

An extra special thank you to my group members, who were simply the greatest.
