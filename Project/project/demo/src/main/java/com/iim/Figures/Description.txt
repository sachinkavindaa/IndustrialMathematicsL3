Dear all,

These results were obtained corresponding to the runge.java and Euler.java
codes considering the Runga kutta fourth order method and Euler method.

To obatined the results considered inatial values as given below.

STAT1 (w) = 0;
STAT3 (x) = 0;
BCL-2 (y) = 0;
BAX   (z) = 0;
Step size (dt) = 0.0001; 
Time duration (time) = 10;
iteration = time/dt;

Reuslts were obatined correspondig to the different S and J value. 
Each and every file renamed as the way i used. 

Example: File name S0J1 means, 

All the results were illustrated relative S and J value respectively.  
In here S = 0 and J = 1

File name describes the S and J value. 

Herewith i have attched the CSV file,Results and Code too. 
If any alternative changes will be informed you.
